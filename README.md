# Fizzbuzzes

This repo holds my fizzbuzzes in different languages. 
Just for fun, and to remind me of different syntaxes available.

To recap, fizzbuzz definition:

Print out numbers from 1 to 100. If the number is divisible 
by 3, print out "Fizz" instead. If the number is divisible by 5, 
print out "Buzz". If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print
"FizzBuzz".

And here are some clarifications, that "should" be clear from 
given definition but sometimes do not seem to: 
-  if the number is divisible by either 3 or 5 (or both), do 
   not print the number. (This should be implied by the "instead".)
-  "from 1 to 100" means integer numbers 1...100, including 
   the endpoints. Note that it does NOT start from 0 and 
   it does include 100.

It seems this is something that can hit you in an interview, 
even though it really is dead-simple to anyone who knows at least 
little bit of programming. If you can't solve this problem, you 
really do NOT know how to program...

## License

Honestly, fizzbuzz is so trivial these should not be 
copyrightable work. Yet, it seems everyone needs to be anal
about these things, so it's MIT license here. If you happen
to solve the problem in exact same verbatim way by yourself, 
I will never sue you for not complying with this license.
